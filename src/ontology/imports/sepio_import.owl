# Class: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/SEPIO_0000174> (statement)

AnnotationAssertion(<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000112> <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/SEPIO_0000174> "The following is derived from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(logic):

Examples of sentences that are (or make) statements:
\"Socrates is a man.\"
\"A triangle has three sides.\"
\"Madrid is the capital of Spain.\"
\"There are five ducks on the lake\"
\"The BRAF V600E mutation causes breast cancer\"

Examples of sentences that are not (or do not make) statements:
\"Who are you?\"
\"Run!\"
\"Greenness perambulates.\"
\"I had one grunch but the eggplant over there.\"
\"The King of France is wise.\"
\"Broccoli tastes good.\"

The first two examples are not declarative sentences and therefore are not (or do not make) statements. The third and fourth are declarative sentences but, lacking meaning, are neither true nor false and therefore are not (or do not make) statements. The fifth and sixth examples are meaningful declarative sentences, but are not statements but rather matters of opinion or taste.")
AnnotationAssertion(<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115> <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/SEPIO_0000174> "An information content entity expressing a declarative sentence that is either true or false.")
AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/SEPIO_0000174> "From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(logic) (2017-06-21):
\"A statement is a declarative sentence that bears truth value, in that it can be either true or false. This definition derives from the domain of logic, where a statement is either (a) a meaningful declarative sentence that is either true or false, or (b) that which a true or false declarative sentence asserts. In the latter case, a statement is distinct from a sentence in that a sentence is only one formulation of a statement, whereas there may be many other formulations expressing the same statement . . . In (this treatment), \"statement\" is introduced in order to distinguish a sentence from its informational content. A statement is regarded as the information content of an information-bearing sentence. Thus, a sentence is related to the statement it bears like a numeral to the number it refers to. Statements are abstract logical entities, while sentences are grammatical entities.\"
----
Note that the definition in (b) describes something closer to the notion of a 'Proposition' as defined in SEPIO?")
AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/SEPIO_0000174> "Statements are sentences (or, more precisely, the information content of sentences) that declare a definitive or proposed fact - expressing something about the world or one's experience of it that may or may not be true. The identity of a particular Statement is dependent upon (1) what it reports as true (its semantic content), (2) the Agent stating it, and (3) the occasion on which the statement is made. 

The phrase \"the pink elephant\" describes an entity, but is not a 'statement' as it has no truth value. By contrast, the phrase \"the pink elephant is in the room\" is a statement as this can be evaluated for its truth.")
