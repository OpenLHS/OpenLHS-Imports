# OPENLHS-IMPORTS Ontology Documentation

Welcome to the OPENLHS-IMPORTS documentation!

You can find descriptions of the standard ontology engineering workflows [here](odk-workflows/index.md).

## Imports
Imports are subsets of external ontologies that contain terms and axioms you would like to re-use in your ontology. These are considered "external", like dependencies in software development, and are not included in your "base" product, which is the [release artefact](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/docs/ReleaseArtefacts.md) which contains only those axioms that you personally maintain.

These are the current imports in ONTOIMPORTS
